	I'm no good at bios, you can ask any tinder date I've ever had.  One thing I am good at though is learning new things, which I seem to have been keen on putting to the test recently.  This first week of class has reassured me that it's a damn good thing that I like a challenge.

	In all seriousness, My name's Luke Stroud.  I'm currently learning how to become a full stack web developer.  I'm enrolled in the UNC Coding Bootcamp program and this is my homework.  I plan to be sufficient in all programming languages necessary to be successful in the modern tech industry. Then get a salaried job with some nice benefits, learn what a 401k is and after that well, who knows, maybe space travel.
